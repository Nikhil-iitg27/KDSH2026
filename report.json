    "Alice Rodriguez: Alice has the capability to crack complex cases but revealing confidential sources is a different action. While she can use her skills, the prohibition against revealing confidential sources means violating this specific prohibition. (severity: 3)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: Alice has the capability to perform ethical investigative work but the prohibition explicitly states she must never return to police work in any capacity. This does not mean she cannot use her skills for other purposes, but performing police work would be a violation. (severity: 3)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: The character Alice Rodriguez has a prohibition against returning to police work. The new constraint states she is 'honest and ethical', which directly contradicts her past trait of accepting bribes and her potential future actions as a skilled investigator. This represents a factual contradiction in the story. (severity: 9)",
    "Detective Bob Chen: Bob chooses to violate his own prohibition against working with Chief Martinez, which is a valid character choice but still constitutes a violation of the established rule. (severity: 3)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: Alice has full police powers but is prohibited from returning to police work. This creates a logical contradiction as she now possesses the capability but is forbidden from using it. (severity: 8)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: Alice violates the prohibition against returning to police work by avoiding Chief Martinez despite her mentorship and selection for a case. (severity: 3)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: Alice is prohibited from returning to police work, but meeting with Detective Bob Chen implies she might be involved in police activities again. (severity: 3)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: Chief Carol Martinez prohibited Alice from returning to police work, but assigning her as a special consultant to the police task force is a clear violation of this prohibition. (severity: 3)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: Bob's trust in Alice is restored despite her prohibition against returning to police work. (severity: 3)",
    "Alice Rodriguez: Alice violated the prohibition against returning to police work by accepting a temporary badge and rejoining the force. (severity: 3)"

Carol used her political connections to open doors that would normally remain closed, sharing insider information about which officials might be compromised. To Alice's surprise, Bob and Carol were working together seamlessly on the investigation, meeting daily to coordinate strategy. Their old tensions seemed forgotten, replaced by professional respect.
