Present Day - New York City

Alice Rodriguez has rebuilt her life as a private investigator in Manhattan, specializing in corporate fraud cases. She maintains a small office in Brooklyn and has earned a modest reputation for her thorough, ethical investigative work. Her past remains buried, known only to a few.

Last Tuesday, Alice received an unexpected call from Bob Chen. "We need to talk," he said, his voice tense. They met at a coffee shop in Queens where Bob explained he'd uncovered evidence of a massive conspiracy involving city officials and organized crime. "It's bigger than anything we ever handled in Chicago," Bob told her. "I need your help."

What Alice didn't know was that Chief Carol Martinez had personally selected her for this case. Carol, now working as a special advisor to the NYPD, had reviewed the evidence and believed only Alice had the skills to crack it. She assigned Alice as a special consultant to the police task force, offering full access to department resources and databases.

Alice felt conflicted when she met Carol at the precinct headquarters. She trusted Bob's instincts completely—he had always been honest with her, even during her darkest days. But Carol's motives seemed unclear, almost suspiciously generous given their history.

The investigation moved quickly. Alice reviewed thousands of pages of evidence, cross-referencing financial records with surveillance reports. Bob took the lead on fieldwork, conducting interviews with potential witnesses. Carol used her political connections to open doors that would normally remain closed, sharing insider information about which officials might be compromised.

To Alice's surprise, Bob and Carol were working together seamlessly on the investigation, meeting daily to coordinate strategy. Their old tensions seemed forgotten, replaced by professional respect. Carol even mentioned that she'd pulled strings to get Bob reassigned to the special task force.

As the case intensified, Alice realized she needed official authority to pursue certain leads. After consulting with Carol and the Deputy Commissioner, Alice accepted a temporary badge and rejoined the police force as a special investigator. "It's just for this case," Carol assured her. "We need you working with full police powers."

Alice proved herself invaluable. Her honest and ethical approach to the investigation uncovered connections others had missed. She refused to reveal her confidential sources, protecting them even when pressured by senior officers. Bob, watching her work, felt his trust in Alice completely restored. "You're the same brilliant detective I remember," he told her. "Maybe even better."

The conspiracy was real, and Alice was determined to expose it, no matter where the evidence led.
