Alice Rodriguez served as a decorated police detective in the Chicago Police Department for nearly a decade. During those years, she worked alongside her partner, Detective Bob Chen, solving over thirty major cases together. They built a reputation as the department's most effective investigative team, earning commendations from Police Chief Carol Martinez, who had personally mentored Alice since her rookie days.

But everything changed three years ago. Internal Affairs discovered that Alice had been accepting bribes from a local crime syndicate in exchange for tipping them off about upcoming raids. The investigation revealed years of corruption, and Alice narrowly avoided criminal prosecution by agreeing to resign immediately. Chief Martinez, feeling betrayed by her former protégé, made Alice sign an agreement: she must never return to police work in any capacity, anywhere in the country. The document was clear and legally binding.

The scandal also destroyed the relationship between Bob and Carol. Bob had suspected Alice's corruption for months but Carol refused to investigate, protecting Alice until the evidence became undeniable. The betrayal shattered Bob's trust in Carol's leadership. After a heated confrontation in Carol's office, Bob transferred to a different precinct with one condition explicitly stated in his personnel file: he cannot and will not work with Chief Martinez ever again under any circumstances.
